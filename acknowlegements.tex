A particularly pernicious myth is that science is moved forward by lone geniuses - 
this idea is just that, a myth. I do not claim to be a genius - nonetheless it would 
have been impossible for me to get this far without an overwhelming amount of 
support, a full account of which would likely be as long as the thesis itself. 
Hopefully, this abbreviated form  will suffice.

Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisors; Ian Dobbie, Martin Booth and Ilan
Davis. Their input, feedback, expertise, and encouragement were invaluable to me. 
Ian in particular was always on hand to offer support and insight at critical 
moments. I owe everyone I worked alongside at Micron during my time a debt 
of gratitude, particularly Mick Philips and David Pinto; building and writing code 
for bespoke super-resolution microscopes has one hell of a learning curve, and 
you made it much easier for me to climb it. Thank you for showing me the ropes,
answering my many questions and for tolerating my more vocal outbursts in the 
office when Python proved particularly adversarial. 

I received incredible support from the Davis lab, particularly from Richard Parton, 
Josh Titlow and Dalia Sara in providing biological samples and key feedback. From 
the Dynamic Optics and Photonics Group, I am extremely grateful to Mantas 
\v{Z}urauskas, Jacopo Antonello and Syed Hussain for their expertise and advice 
on adaptive optics. It has been my immense pleasure to work alongside such 
accomplished individuals. I hope they are pleased with my work herein in alloying
their expertise into a single product.

I would also like to thank Sara Abrahamsson and Marcel M\"{u}ller for their 
encouragement and willingness to collaborate with me on a number of occasions. 
Even as the junior partner to such endeavours, my contributions and input always
felt valued. They treated me as a colleague and a scientist, and that has empowered
me to act as such.

I have been blessed with many wonderful friends. Rick and Sarah have shown me 
boundless  compassion and encouragement. They have been steadfast bulwarks when I 
needed them most. I will never forget their faultless kindness to me. Barney, Leah, 
John-Luke, Simon, Jon, and Tim ...

Finally, I would like to thank my family; my parents, Trevor and Karen, my 
sister and her husband, Annabelle and Christopher, and my sister, Meghan. They
have  consistently been my most vocal supporters, and fierce sources of love and
encouragement. The fruits of my labour thus far are a testament to the good 
soil I was planted in and the nourishment I received from them.

You all have my eternal gratitude.}
