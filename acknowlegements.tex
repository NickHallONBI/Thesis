		A particularly pernicious myth is that science is moved forward by lone geniuses - 
		this idea is just that, a myth and I certainly do not claim to be a genius. 
		Nonetheless it would have been impossible for me to get this far without an 
		overwhelming amount of support, a full account of which would likely be as long 
		as the thesis itself. Hopefully, this abbreviated form  will suffice.
		
		Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisors; Ian Dobbie, Martin Booth and Ilan
		Davis. Their input, feedback, expertise, and encouragement were invaluable to me. 
		Ian in particular was always on hand to offer support and insight at critical 
		moments. I owe everyone I worked alongside at Micron during my time a debt 
		of gratitude, particularly Mick Philips and David Pinto; building and writing code 
		for bespoke super-resolution microscopes has one hell of a learning curve, and 
		you made it much easier for me to climb it. Thank you for showing me the ropes,
		answering my many questions and for tolerating my more vocal outbursts in the 
		office when Python proved particularly adversarial. 
		
		I received incredible support from the Davis lab, particularly from Richard Parton, 
		Josh Titlow and Dalia Sara in providing biological samples and key feedback. From 
		the Dynamic Optics and Photonics Group, I am extremely grateful to Mantas 
		\v{Z}urauskas, Jacopo Antonello and Syed Hussain for their expertise and advice 
		on adaptive optics. It has been my immense pleasure to learn from and work 
		alongside such accomplished individuals. 
		
		I would also like to thank Sara Abrahamsson and Marcel M\"{u}ller for their 
		encouragement and willingness to collaborate with me on a number of occasions. 
		Even as the junior partner to such endeavours, my contributions and input always
		felt valued. They treated me as a colleague and a scientist, and that has empowered
		me to act as such.
		
		Rick, Sarah, Barney, Leah, John-Luke, Simon, Jon, and Tim have all given me 
		unflagging support, encouragement, and enthusiasm, as well as being boundless sources 
		of joy and levity. They have been steadfast bulwarks when I needed them most. I will 
		never forget their faultless kindness to me. If a man's wealth is indeed measured by 
		his friendships, I think I am rich beyond all measure.
		
		Finally, I would like to thank my family; my parents, Trevor and Karen, my 
		sister and her husband, Annabelle and Christopher, and my sister, Meghan. They
		have  consistently been my most vocal supporters, and fierce sources of love and
		encouragement. The fruits of my labour thus far are a testament to the good 
		soil I was planted in and the nourishment I received from them.
		
		You all have my eternal gratitude.}
